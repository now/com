# COM #

COM is an object-oriented wrapper around WIN32OLE.  COM makes it easy to add
behavior to WIN32OLE objects, making them easier to work with from Ruby.

    module Word end

    class Word::Application < COM::Instantiable
      def without_interaction
        with_properties('displayalerts' => Word::WdAlertsNone){ yield }
      end

      def documents
        Word::Documents.new(com.documents)
      end

      def quit(saving = Word::WdDoNotSaveChanges, *args)
        com.quit saving, *args
      end
    end
